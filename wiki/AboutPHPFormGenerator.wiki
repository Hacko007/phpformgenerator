= Introduction =

If you worked some time with PHP/MySQL you will notice that you spend much time in doing same thing over and over. You need often to do a form that should change some data in some database table or you need to create PHP class and work with objects in stead of direct pulling/pushing data from database.

I did application that helps you to create such class or edit form for specific database table.


= How it works =

* You should get source code and place it on your web site. 
* Protect directory access
* Change config.php  with login information for your MySQL database
* Open index.php page in your browser.
* Choose database
* Choose table 
* Choose if you want to generate edit form or PHP class for chosen table
* Select columns 
* Generate code
